\usage{
make_teaching_mat_public(WD = "?", uinfo = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{WD}{is working directory of the project; easiest way to supply a different lesson is with "?", which will invoke \code{\link[=pick_lesson]{pick_lesson()}}; default is WD=getwd()}

\item{uinfo}{is a data frame of unit info, typically read from the "Titles" tab of the teach-it_*.gsheet; default is NULL, which will cause the function to read it in}
}
\value{
A logical TRUE/FALSE indicating overall success. NA if no action was needed (i.e. teaching-materials already at GalacticPolymath)
}
\description{
A helper function for \code{\link[=organize_teach_it]{organize_teach_it()}}, which is part of \code{\link[=compile_teach_it]{compile_teach_it()}}. Moves/organizes teaching-materials folder to the GalacticPolymath/ shared drive, where it is viewable and copyable by GP+ members.
Does the following:
\enumerate{
\item Move teaching-materials/ content from the WD (project working directory on GP-Studio) to GalacticPolymath Shared Drive (Read-Only access)
\item Create shortcut to teaching-materials/ in place of the moved folder
\item Rename teaching-materials with a full "MediumTitle" i.e. more descriptive than typical working title of project
\item Update teach-it_*.gsheet DownloadLinks to reflect these file rearrangements
\item Make the following updates to front-matter:
\itemize{
\item GdriveTeachMatPath: 'GalacticPolymath/MediumTitle'
}
}
}
