\usage{
editor(WD = "?", system_browser = TRUE, run_in_bg = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{WD}{Character. A local virtualized path to a lesson folder where Google Drive (Web) path
will be extracted from front matter. Passing \code{"?"} invokes \code{\link{pick_lesson}()}.
Default is \code{"?"}.}

\item{system_browser}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), the app opens in the system default web browser.
If \code{FALSE}, it opens in the RStudio viewer pane (if available).}

\item{run_in_bg}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), runs the app in a background R process using \code{callr::r_bg}.
The app URL will be opened in a browser from the main R session, and the R session remains free.
If \code{FALSE}, runs the app blocking in the current R session (useful for debugging).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the \code{callr} background process object if \code{run_in_bg = TRUE}.
Returns \code{NULL} invisibly if \code{run_in_bg = FALSE}.
}
\description{
Starts the Shiny app for editing front matter of lessons, supporting markdown syntax.
The app is located in the \code{inst/shiny/gp_editor} directory of the \code{galacticPubs} package.
}
\details{
When run in background mode, the Shiny app runs in a separate R process,
and the browser window is opened from the main R session.
The background process will keep running until stopped manually.
In blocking mode, the app runs in the current session and blocks until closed.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run the editor in background mode (default)
editor()

# Run the editor blocking in the current R session for debugging
editor(run_in_bg = FALSE)
}
