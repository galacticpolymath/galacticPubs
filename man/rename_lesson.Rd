\usage{
rename_lesson(
  new_name,
  gh_proj_name,
  lessons_dir,
  change_this = NULL,
  preserve_spaces = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_name}{The new name you want to give the selected project}

\item{gh_proj_name}{The unique project title of this lesson which is prefixed on the lesson folder name and the GitHub project. Not necessarily the same as the ShortTitle used in naming lesson presentations and worksheets; probably more specific with underscores; If left off, will try to get this info from the GitHubPath if available in the front-matter.yml.}

\item{lessons_dir}{path to the virtualized folder Edu/lessons, where all the lessons are found; default="/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/Edu/Lessons"}

\item{change_this}{passed to \code{\link[=update_fm]{update_fm()}} if you want to make any other changes to front matter. Must be a list of values to change in the front matter before rebuilding. Default=NULL. Example: list(Title="Stormy Misty's Foal") would change the title of the lesson to the name of a horsey book If gh_proj_name=="all", make sure you set this to something you want to change for everything.}

\item{preserve_spaces}{if some files have a space in the 'Short Title', do you want to preserve this? default=FALSE}
}
\description{
Don't run this from the RStudio session of the lesson you want to rename! Does several things:
\enumerate{
\item Renames top-level folder of the lesson
\item Finds and renames all file names found in the project folder e.g. OldShortName_yadayada.* -> NewShortName_yadayada. This is done locally using Google Drive for Desktop virtualization of the Lessons Folder
\item Changes name of GitHub Repo at galacticpolymath/ and galacticpolymath/catalog
\item Reassociates lesson folder to new GitHub name with \code{\link[=gh_reset_remote]{gh_reset_remote()}}
\item Changes the ShortName and GPCatalogPath and GitHubPath items in front-matter.yml using \code{\link[=update_fm]{update_fm()}}.
}
}
\details{
Assumes that you have Google Drive for Desktop set up with access to Lessons/ folder; github and gh CLI set up with proper permissions with GP GitHub. Will ignore case to account for different user behaviors.
