\usage{
gh_reset_remote(
  new_name,
  WD = getwd(),
  check_current_gh = FALSE,
  run_check_wd = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_name}{The name of the new (empty) repo you want to connect to (should be exactly as it is named on \url{https://github.com/galacticpolymath}); It's just the project name--a full URL is not expected.}

\item{WD}{working directory; default= getwd()}

\item{check_current_gh}{do you want to check whether the current listed GitHubPath in the front-matter.yml is good? If T, will throw an error and stop if a current GitHub connection does not exist. default=F}

\item{run_check_wd}{logical; do you want to run \code{\link[=check_wd]{check_wd()}}? Basically looks for files and folders you expect in a valid lesson project. default=TRUE}
}
\description{
Change the GitHub URL associated with this project (i.e. after you rename the repo on \url{https://github.com/galacticpolymath}) or after you've "forked" a project to make a new language version of the project. That is, you're specifying an \emph{existing GitHub Repository's URL} that you want your local RStudio session to connect to when tracking changes. You don't have to specify the whole URL, just the specific name of the project (\code{new_name}) \emph{exactly as it's spelled on GitHub}.
}
\details{
Will run some validation checks and let you know whether the new_name repo exists on the web. May also prompt to run \code{\link[=editor]{editor()}} to initialize some fields.
