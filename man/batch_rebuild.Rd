\arguments{
\item{shortName}{What is the lesson short name (i.e. the folder name) for the lesson you want to update and rebuild; use "all" if you want to rebuild all the lessons.}

\item{lessons_dir}{path to the virtualized folder Edu/lessons, where all the lessons are found; default="/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/Edu/Lessons"}

\item{change_this}{A list of values to change in the front matter before rebuilding. Default=NULL. Example: list(Title="Stormy Misty's Foal") would change the title of the lesson to the name of a horsey novel. If shortName=="all", make sure you set this to something you want to change for everything.}

\item{clean}{Do you want to clean the meta/JSON folder and build everything from scratch? (Gets passed to \code{\link[=compile_lesson]{compile_lesson()}}). Default=TRUE}

\item{complete_rebuild}{Do you want to force rebuild everything (even if a particular item seems up to date?) default=FALSE (This par gets passed on as rebuild to \code{\link[=compile_lesson]{compile_lesson()}})}
