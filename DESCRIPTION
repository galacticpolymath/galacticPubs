Description: Code to compile standards information from a lesson alignment matrix
    worksheet, match with data from the StandardX repository, and output structured
    tibbles and JSON for use downstream. Tibbles can be used to generate a GP Learning
    Chart or Epaulette and the JSON output is used for the standards section of our
    GP Sensible Lesson Plan format. There are also functions for working with color
    and styling for ggplot2 and other R-based outputs.
